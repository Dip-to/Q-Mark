# Q-Mark
# About the app :
Q-Mark is a social media network based on education that allows students to
find slides, questions, and other resources on a variety of topics.

The goal is to provide students with sufficient benefits from a platform. Our
main motivation is to make things easier for students by offering everything they need
for their studies under one platform. Itâ€™s less time consuming and offers more options
(questions, slides of both home and abroad Universities) to make himself/herself
better than before. Also to establish communication between users we have created a
chat environment. The app also has many features besides upload content and search
content. This app allows students to ask others about their problems and anyone with
knowledge and experience on the topic can provide useful resources and information.
Users also get notification from the other users. With this app a student can also chat
with others. This feature helps to establish communication between other users.
